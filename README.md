About
-------
It is a simple app that helps both students and general users of the UFRGS library. The user can check the status of every borrowed book, getting information about the return date and the current fine if it was not returned in time. 
This app uses Alamofire to perform every request. 

We do not have any link with UFRGS and we do not have intention to earn money with this project. The main goal with this is help users and share knowledge. 

Open Source
-----------
We've made it open source to share the way we are using Swift, Interface Builder and Xcode.
